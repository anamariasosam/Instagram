    <p class="app__legal_subtitle">Information Collection and Use</p>
    <p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve our Services from time to time.</p>
    <p>Share, Re-post & Settings: Our Services are primarily designed to help you share your Instagram’s photos with your clients. Our default setting is almost always to make the information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Catlog. Our Services broadly and instantly disseminate your public information to a wide range of users, customers, and services. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Cookies</span>: Like many apps, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional application usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. Catlog may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Most applications automatically accept cookies.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Google Analytics</span>: We will also install Google Analytics in the apps, devices, or mobile apps to collect your behaviors in using our Services. We will also recommend some other services that may be suitable or appeal to you based on our analysis.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span><br>
    We do not disclose your private personal information except in the limited circumstances described here.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Your Consent</span>: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your Catlog account.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Law and Harm</span>: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Catlog's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a government, request to disclose your information.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Business Transfers and Affiliates</span>: In the event that Catlog is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services including the delivery of ads.</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Non-Private or Non-Personal Information</span>: We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, the people you share your information with, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have removed any private personal information (such as your name or contact information).</p>

    <p><span class="app__legal_subtitle">Changes to this Policy</span><br>
    We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at
